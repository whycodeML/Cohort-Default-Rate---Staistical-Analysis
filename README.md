# Cohort-Default-Rate---Staistical-Analysis
Analyzed Educational Institution factors and Demographic factors that impact the Cohort Default Rate (CDR) 
for 6694 institutions, 41 accreditation agencies and 10 regions to formulate possible recommendations for 
target stakeholders to minimise the problem. Used Multi Level Fixed and Random effects models in R using LOG(CDR) 
as the predictor variable. Understood the marginal effects and performed assumption testing like Multi-collinearity, 
Independence test, etc.
